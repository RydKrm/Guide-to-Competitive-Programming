### Recursion 
Recustoin in computer scientce is a technique where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. 
#### Exampe
Let's write a program for going home from position 1 to `Home` position. How do write an recursion algorithm for that?
#### Algorithm 
goHome:
 1. if current position is `Home` then stop 
 2. step 1 move forwards
 3. back to step 1

```cpp
void  goHome(x, Home){
    if(x == Home){
        printf("I am at my Home");
        return;
    }
    x++;
    goHome(x, Home);
}
int main(){
    int x = 0, Home = 10;
    goHome(x,Home);
}
```

### Principle of Recurtion
 1. Figure of the smallest case 
 2. Always assume the subproblem can be solved 
 3. solve the curent prob;em assuming subproblem solution exists
