### Fibonacci Series 

Find the `nth` fibonacci series using recurtion alsorithm? 

#### Solution
 The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.
This will be a two way recustion algorithm to find that.

#### Recursive Algorithm Explanation

##### Base Cases:
If the input number n is 0, return 0. This is because the 0th Fibonacci number is 0.
If n is 1, return 1. This is because the 1st Fibonacci number is 1.

##### Recursive Case:
For any n greater than 1, the Fibonacci number at position n is the sum of the Fibonacci numbers at positions n-1 and n-2.
This can be expressed as: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

#### Complexity 
The naive recursive approach has an exponential time complexity, `O(2^n)`, because it recomputes values multiple times. For larger values of n, it becomes very inefficient.


#### Code 
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


int fib(int n){
	if(n==0 or n==1){
		return n;
	}
	int f1 = fib(n-1);
	int f2 = fib(n-2);
	return f1 + f2;
}

int main(){
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	cout<<fib(n) <<endl;
}
``` 

##### Better complexity code 

To reduce the complexity of the Fibonacci sequence calculation, you can use two main approaches: Memoization and the Iterative Approach. Both significantly improve efficiency compared to the naive recursive method.

```cpp
int fibonacci_memo(int n, std::vector<int>& memo) {
    // Base cases
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    
    // Check if value is already computed
    if (memo[n] != -1) return memo[n];
    
    // Recursive case with memoization
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n - 2, memo);
    return memo[n];
}
```

In this code using `memorization` to not compute the part which is calculate before
