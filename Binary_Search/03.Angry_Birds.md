#### Problem 
There is a long wire along at straigth line, which contains `N` bird nests at positions `x1, x2, ..., xN`. 

There are `B (B<=N)` birds, which becomes angry towards each other once put into a nest. To put the birds from hurting each other yopu want to assign birds to nests such that minimum distance between any two birds is as large as possible. 

What is the largest minimum distance? 

#### Example 
Input :- `N = 5`, `B = 3`, `Nests = [1,2,4,8,9]` <br>
Output :- `3`

#### Logic to solve
Let's say if their are two birds then put those in position `start = 1` and `end = 9`. But what if need to put three birds. Then there could be a possible way is put another bird at position `mid = (start + end)/2` and check if it's possible or not. 
As the questoin says find the minimun then if it's possible to put bird at `mid` try o find the more accurate ans and search in the right side. If not possible then try to find in the left side. 

SO their are `N` position and `B` birds. Let's start with max distance which is `maxDis = nests[n-1] - nest[0]`. If it possible
to positioned all the birds in that locations if the answer is true, then try for more accurate answer. which will be more
than answer, if not possible then try for lower number fo that . 

#### Code 
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;


bool canPlaceBirds(int B,int N,vector<int> nests,int sep){

	int birds = 1;
	int location = nests[0];

	for(int i=1; i<=N-1; i++){
		int current_location = nests[i];
		if(current_location - location >= sep){
			birds++;
			location = current_location;

			if(birds==B){
				return true;
			}
		}
	}
	return false;

}


int main(){
	int B = 3;
	vector<int> nests{1,2,4,8,9};
	//sorting
	sort(nests.begin(),nests.end());
	int N = nests.size();

	//Binary Search
	int s = 0;
	int e = nests[N-1] - nests[0];
	int ans = -1;

	while(s<=e){
		int mid = (s+e)/2;

		bool canPlace = canPlaceBirds(B,N,nests,mid);
		if(canPlace){
			ans = mid;
			s = mid + 1;
		}
		else{
			e = mid - 1;
		}
	}

	cout << ans <<endl;

	return 0;
}
```

#### Complexity 
 - `O(N*log(mx-mn))`
