### Backtracking 
It is an algorithmic technique for solving problem in recursively trying to built a solution or try yo searching the entire search space to solve a computation problem. 
In backtracking try to find solution in a certains way but most important thing is , if the solution not exists in that way then came back or go backward to find a new way to solve problem 

### Problem Types 
 1. Decision Problem - It is used for find any solution. Like given grid and need to find a way from one place to another place. Cost does not matter just check if it possible or not
 2. Optimisation Problem - It is used to find the best solution. Find the minimum cost in a grid from one place to another place 
 3. Enumeration Problem - It is used to find all solution. Find all the way of any const in a grid for travelling from one place to another place.
