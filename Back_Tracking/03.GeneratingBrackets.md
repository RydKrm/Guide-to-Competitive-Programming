#### Problem 
Write a function to generate all the possible n pairs of balanced parentheses `(` and `)`. 

#### Example 
Input :- N = 2 <br>
Output :- `(())`, `()()`

#### Logic 
Try to solve this problem with back tracking and recursion algorithm. Because this problem is try to generate all the possible solution for a give permutation. 

For a input `N` the total numnber of brackets will be `2*N` half will be opening and other half will be closing brackets. 
Start with two variable `opening = 0` and `closing = 0`. Which indecate the number of `opening` and `closing` brackets. Now If a new bracket is added then their must be two rule to checking here :- 

 1. number of opening bracket can not be greater then `N`. 
 2. Number of closing bracket can be greater then number of opening brackets 
   
Follow this two logic and make recursive calls to solve the problem 

#### Code 

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector> 
using namespace std;

void generateBracket(int n, int opening, int closing, vector<char> curr, vector<vector<char>> &result){

    if(opening == n && closing == n) {
        result.push_back(curr);
        return;
    }

    if(opening < n){
        curr.push_back('(');
        generateBracket(n, opening + 1, closing, curr, result);
        curr.pop_back();
    }

    if(closing < opening){
        curr.push_back(')');
        generateBracket(n, opening, closing + 1, curr, result);
    }
}

int main(){
   int n;
   cin>>n;

   vector<vector<char>> result;
   vector<char> curr; 
   int opening = 0, closing = 0;
   generateBracket(n, opening, closing, curr, result);

   for(vector<char> res : result) {
     for(char c:res){
        printf("%c", c);
     }
     cout<<endl;
   }
   return 0;
}
