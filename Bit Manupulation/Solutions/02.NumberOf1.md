### Statement

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/) <br>
Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of
set bits. It has (also known as the Hamming weight).

### Example

input = 11 output = 3

### Login

Make it a binary string and and count the number of 1. Use the `bit masking technique`. Take `mask = 1` which in binary `...00001`. If I left shift 1 time using `mask<<1` that will make it `...0010`. Again left shift 2 time makes it `...0100`. Now while increasing the mask if an and operation made with number n that will give the bit position. For example `n = 5` so `5 & 001 => 101 & 001 => 1`. So the left most bit is set bit. Now increasing the left shift and make AND Operation.

### Example

Let `n = 12` and `ans = 0` which binary representation is `n = 1011` <br>

AND Operation with bit `n & 1<<1 => 1011 & 0001 => 1`. Increase `ans += 1` <br>
AND Operation with bit `n & 1<<2 => 1011 & 0010 => 1`. Increase `ans += 1` <br>
AND Operation with bit `n & 1<<3 => 1011 & 0100 => 0`. Increase `ans not increase` <br>
AND Operation with bit `n & 1<<4 => 1011 & 1000 => 1`. Increase `ans += 1` <br>

return `ans = 3`

### Complexity

- Time O(1)
- Space O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        ans, mask = 0 , 1
        for i in range(32):
          if n&(1<<i):
            ans += 1
        return ans

```
