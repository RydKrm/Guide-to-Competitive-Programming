### Statement

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

### Example

Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output: 964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)

### Logic

This is all about a bitt manipulation problem. Let say the number is `n = 00000010100101000001111010011100`. From the statement it is always be 32-bit. Now loop through the number for left to right and check the number is set or not using bit masking. for every loop iteration first add a `0` bit in the end and then check `n & (1<<i)` if set add `1` to the number. Which will reverse the number.

### Explanation with Example

Let `n = 12` which binary representation will be `...1011` and `answer = 0` which binary is also `0000...0000` <br>
Now Loop `form i=0 to i=32` <br>
Iteration - 1 <br>
`answer = answer <<1` => `answer = ...000`
`n & (1<<1) == True` => `answer += 1` => binary `...0001`

Iteration - 2 <br>
`answer = answer <<1` => `answer = ...0010`
`n & (1<<1) == True` => `answer += 1` => binary `...0011`

Iteration - 3 <br>
`answer = answer <<1` => `answer = ...00110`
`n & (1<<1) == False` => `NOT ADD`

Iteration - 4 <br>
`answer = answer <<1` => `answer = ...001100`
`n & (1<<1) == True` => `answer += 1` => binary `...001101`

Iteration - 5 <br>
`answer = answer <<1` => `answer = ...0011010`
`n & (1<<1) == False` => `NOT ADD`

Iteration - 6 <br>
`answer = answer <<1` => `answer = ...00110100`
`n & (1<<1) == False` => `NOT ADD` <br>

SO ON

### Complexity

- Time O(n)
- Space O(n)

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        answer = 0
        for i in range(32):
          answer = answer*2
          if n&(1<<i):
            answer += 1
        return answer
```
