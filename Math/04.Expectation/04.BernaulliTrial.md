### Bernaulli Trial 

An experiment is called bernaulli trial if it  has exactly two outcomes, one of which is desired 

For example, Flipping a coin, selecting a number from 1 to 100 is that prime or not

#### Theorem 01 
If the probability of success of a bernaulli trial is `p` then the expected number od trials to get a success is `1/p`<br>

###### Example
Let's flip a coin and probability of getting a Head is , `p(x) = 1/2`, Then the expected number is `x = 1/p` ` =>1/1/2` `=> 2`

#### Theorem 02 
If probability of getting success in Bernanulli trials is `p` then exected number of successess in `n` trials in `np` <br>

###### Example 
`N` students are asked to choose a number form 1 to 100. What is the expected number of student that would choose a single digit number?

For a single student the probability of choose a number is `9/100`. Then from theorem 2, for `N` students is `9*N/100`
