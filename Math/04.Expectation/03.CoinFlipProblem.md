### Problem
What is the expected number of coin need to flip to get a Head?

### Solution
In a coin throw you can get either Head or Tail. So the probability of getting a Head is `1/2`

Now the expectation will be ;-

`x = summation xi * P(xi)` <br>

First throw a coin and the expectation of get a Head is `1 * 1/2` If i not get a Head then then One 
more throw is need, then the expectation will be `(1 + x)*1/2`. <br>
`x = 1*(1/2) + (1+x)*(1/2)` <br>
`2x = 1 + 1 + x` <br>
`x = 2` <br>

So minimum Two throw need to get a `Head`
