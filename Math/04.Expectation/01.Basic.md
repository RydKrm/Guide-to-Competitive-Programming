#### Expectation 
Expectation = average value of a random variable 

##### Continuous variable
Today's temparature is `10deg cel`. But it can be `10.1` or `10.2` and so on. 

##### Discrite Variable
Which has a fixed value like `x = 10` . It cannot be `10.1`
**What is the expected value of `1` if you throw a dice?** 
Total random variable = 6 {1,2,3,4,5,6}

so  the expected variable = `1 / 6`

##### Mathematically
For a discrete variable `X` with probability function `P(x)`, the expected value `E(X)` is given by 
`summation xi*P(xi)` the summation runs over all the distinct values xi that variable can take. 

From the dice problem :-

Discrite Random Variable : ` X = {1,2,3,4,5,6} ` <br>
The Probability Function : ` P = {1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6} ` <br>
Expectation : `E(x) = {1*1/6 + 2*1/6 + 3*1/6 + 4*1/6 + 5*1/6 + 1*6/6 } ` <br>
             `E(x) = 1/6(1+2+3+4+5+6)`  <br>
             `E(x) = 21/6 = 3.5`

Which means that the average value of getting from rolling a dice is `3.5`. This the expectation
