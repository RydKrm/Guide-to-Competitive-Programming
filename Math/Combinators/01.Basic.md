### Permutations

Permutations are arranging `R` distinct objects out of a collection of `N` objects can be calculated using the following formula :
`nPr = (n!)/ (n-r)!`

### Combinations

Permutations are arranging `R` distinct objects out of a collection of `N` objects can be calculated using the following formula :
`nPr = (n!)/ ( (n-r)! * r!)`

#### Basic combinatorics rules

1.  **The Rule of Product :** If there are `X` number of ways to choose one element from `A` and `Y` number of ways to choose one element from `B`. Then, there will be `X*Y` number of ways to choose two elements, one from `A` and one from `B`
2.  **The Rule of Sum :** If there are `X` number of ways to choose one element from `A` and `Y` number of ways to choose one element from `B`. Then, there will be `X*Y` number of ways to choose one element that can belong to either `A` or to `B`
