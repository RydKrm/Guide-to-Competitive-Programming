### Birthday Paradox Problem

What should be the minimum number of people that should be present in a hall so that there's at least `50%` change of two people have the same birthday.

#### Solution

To compute that first need to twist the question in reverse. Like what is the probability of find the two people whose birthday is not the same.
<br>
First check for 1 person then the probability will be 100% to not have the same birthday. because `365/365 = 1`.
<br>
then let's check for 2 person, that will be `(365/365) * (364/365) = 99.72` that not having a same birthday. Here first person will choose a day from 365 day but second person will choose from 364 days
<br>
Now for 3 person, that will be `(365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365)= 99.17`. <br>

And so on, So we need a loop and check when the birthday probability will be less then or equal to `50`

#### Code

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


int main(){

	int people = 1;
	float num = 365;
	float denom = 365;
	float prob_diff_bday = 1;
	while(1){
		prob_diff_bday = prob_diff_bday * (num/denom);
		//cout<<"People "<<people <<" Prob : "<<prob_diff_bday <<endl;
		if(prob_diff_bday  < 0.5){
			break;
		}
		num--;
		people++;
	}
	cout<<"Final Ans " <<people<<endl;
	return 0;
}
```
