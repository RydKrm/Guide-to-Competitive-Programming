### Inverse Modulo

The inverse modulo of a number `a` with respect to a modulus `m` is a number `b` such that:
`a⋅b ≡ 1(mod m)`

This means that `a` and `b` multiply to give a product that is congruent to 1 when 
divided by `m`. In simpler terms, `b` is the number you multiply `a` by to get a remainder of 1 when 
divided by `m`.

**Which only possible if `a` and `m` always exists a coprime**
