### Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermat's Little Theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, particularly in the field of modular arithmetic. It provides a useful property of prime numbers and has significant applications in cryptography, primality testing, and number theory

Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer such that a is not divisible by p (a and p are coprime), then

`a^(p−1) ≡ 1 (mod p)`
where `p` must be a coprime and `a` and `p` are coprime.

### Examples of Fermat's Little Theorem

#### Example 1:
Let \( p = 7 \) and \( a = 3 \):

\[ 3^{7-1} = 3^6 = 729 \]

To check the congruence modulo \( 7 \):

\[ 729 \div 7 = 104 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 729 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]

Thus, \( 3^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).

#### Example 2:
Let \( p = 11 \) and \( a = 2 \):

\[ 2^{11-1} = 2^{10} = 1024 \]

To check the congruence modulo \( 11 \):

\[ 1024 \div 11 = 93 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 1024 \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \]

Thus, \( 2^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \).
