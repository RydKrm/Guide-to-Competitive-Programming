### Extended Euclidean Algorithm

This is used to find out the solution of the following equation:-
`Ax + By = GCD(A,B)` <br>
As an input you are given `A` and `B`. Fnd the value of `x`, `y`? This equation is used for finding the multiplicative modulo inverse and linean diophantine equations.

#### solution

That equation can be write as :-
`A*Y1 + B* floor(X1 - floor(A/B)*Y1) = GCD(A,B)`
Using coefficient equal with first equation, we can write :-
`X = Y1` and `Y = X1 - floor(A/B)*Y1` <br>
where `X1` and `Y1` is another value of `x` and `Y`.

#### Example

Solve the equation :- `18x + 30y = gcd(18,30)` using extended euclidean algorithm? <br>

`=> 18x + 30y = gcd(18, 30)` `(2,-1)`<br>
`=> 30*x1 + 18*y1 = gcd(30,18)` `(-1, 2)`<br>
`=> 18*x2 + 12*y2 = gcd(18,12)` `(1,-1)`<br>
`=> 12*x3 + 6*y3 = gcd(12,6)` `(0,1)` <br>
`=> 6*x4 + 0*y4 = gcd(6,0)` => `(1,0)`<br>

So the `x4 = 1` and `y4 = 0` which satisfy the last equation. Now go upward to satisfy other conditions and find the solution for other conditions. Which is `x = 2` and `y = -1`

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

//Euclid's Algorithm
int gcd(int a,int b){
	if(b==0){
		return a;
	}
	return gcd(b, a%b);
}

// Extended Euclid's Algorithm ax + by = gcd(a,b)
vector<int> extendedGCD(int a,int b){
	if(b==0){
		//return the values of x and y
		return {1,0,a};
	}
	vector<int> result = extendedGCD(b, a%b);
	// After recursive call is over
	int smallX = result[0];
	int smallY = result[1];
	int gcd  = result[2];

	int x = smallY;
	int y = smallX - (a/b)*smallY;

	return {x,y, gcd};
}

int main(){

	int a,b;
	cin>>a>>b;

	// a x + b y = gcd (a,b);
	int x,y;
	vector<int> result = extendedGCD(a,b);
	cout<< result[0] <<" and "<<result[1] << " gcd " << result[2] << endl;

	cout <<"Algorithm Euclid's "<< gcd(a,b) <<endl;

	return 0;
}

```
