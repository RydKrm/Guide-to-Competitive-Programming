### Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermat's Little Theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, particularly in the field of modular arithmetic. It provides a useful property of prime numbers and has significant applications in cryptography, primality testing, and number theory

Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer such that a is not divisible by p (a and p are coprime), then

`a^(p−1) ≡ 1 (mod p)`
where `p` must be a coprime and `a` and `p` are coprime.
