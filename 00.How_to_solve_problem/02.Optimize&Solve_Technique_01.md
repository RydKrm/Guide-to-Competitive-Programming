**Bottlenecks**
A bottleneck is a part of your algorithm that slows down the overall runtime.
You have one-time work that slows down your algorithm. For example, suppose you have a two-step algorithm where you first sort the array and then you find elements with a particular property. The first step is `O(N log N)` and the second step is `O(N)`. Perhaps you could reduce the second step to `O(log N)` or `O(1)`, but would it matter? Not too much. It's certainly not a priority, as the `O(N log N)` is the bottleneck. Until you optimize the first step, your overall algorithm will be `O(N log N)`

**Unnecessary Work**
Undone the unnecessary work work. If an problem can be solved with `O(N)` then don't try to use `O(N^2)`

**Duplicated Work**
